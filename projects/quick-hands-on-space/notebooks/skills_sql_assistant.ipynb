    "## Build SQL Assistant with ondemand skills\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use **progressive disclosure** - a context management technique where the agent loads information on-demand rather than upfront - to implement skills (specialized prompt-based instructions). The agent loads skills via tool calls, rather than dynamically changing the system prompt, discovering and loading only the skills it needs for each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use case**: Imagine building an agent to help write SQL queries across different business verticals in a large enterprise. Your organization might have separate datastores for each vertical, or a single monolithic database with thousands of tables. Either way, loading all schemas upfront would overwhelm the context window. Progressive disclosure solves this by loading only the relevant schema when needed. This architecture also enables different product owners and stakeholders to independently contribute and maintain skills for their specific business verticals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we will build**: A SQL query assistant with two skills (sales analytics and inventory management). The agent sees lightweight skill descriptions in its system prompt, then loads full database schemas and business logic through tool calls only when relevant to the user’s query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the flow when a user asks for a SQL query:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/progressive_disclosure_of_skills.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why progressive disclosure :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduces context usage** - load only the 2-3 skills needed for a task, not all available skills\n",
    "- **Enables team autonomy** - different teams can develop specialized skills independently (similar to other multi-agent architectures)\n",
    "- **Scales efficiently** - add dozens or hundreds of skills without overwhelming context\n",
    "- **Simplifies conversation history** - single agent with one conversation thread\n",
