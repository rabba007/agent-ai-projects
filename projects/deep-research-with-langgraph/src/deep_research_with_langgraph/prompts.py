"""Prompt templates for the deep research system.

This module contains all prompt templates used across the research workflow components,
including user clarification, research brief generation, and report synthesis.
"""

clarify_with_user_instructions="""
These are the messages that have been exchanged so far from the user asking for the report:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

Assess whether you need to ask a clarifying question, or if the user has already provided enough information for you to start research.
IMPORTANT: If you can see in the messages history that you have already asked a clarifying question, you almost always do not need to ask another one. Only ask another question if ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

If there are acronyms, abbreviations, or unknown terms, ask the user to clarify.
If you need to ask a question, follow these guidelines:
- Be concise while gathering all necessary information
- Make sure to gather all the information needed to carry out the research task in a concise, well-structured manner.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists if appropriate for clarity. Make sure that this uses markdown formatting and will be rendered correctly if the string output is passed to a markdown renderer.
- Don't ask for unnecessary information, or information that the user has already provided. If you can see that the user has already provided the information, do not ask for it again.

Respond in valid JSON format with these exact keys:
"need_clarification": boolean,
"question": "<question to ask the user to clarify the report scope>",
"verification": "<verification message that we will start research>"

If you need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": true,
"question": "<your clarifying question>",
"verification": ""

If you do not need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": false,
"question": "",
"verification": "<acknowledgement message that you will now start research based on the provided information>"

For the verification message when no clarification is needed:
- Acknowledge that you have sufficient information to proceed
- Briefly summarize the key aspects of what you understand from their request
- Confirm that you will now begin the research process
- Keep the message concise and professional

transform_messages_into_research_topic_prompt= """You will be given a set of messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user. 
Your job is to translate these messages into a more detailed and concrete research question that will be used to guide the research.

The messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user are:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

You will return a single research question that will be used to guide the research.

Guidelines:
1. Maximize Specificity and Detail
- Include all known user preferences and explicitly list key attributes or dimensions to consider.
- It is important that all details from the user are included in the instructions.

2. Handle Unstated Dimensions Carefully
- When research quality requires considering additional dimensions that the user hasn't specified, acknowledge them as open considerations rather than assumed preferences.
- Example: Instead of assuming "budget-friendly options," say "consider all price ranges unless cost constraints are specified."
- Only mention dimensions that are genuinely necessary for comprehensive research in that domain.

3. Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions
- Never invent specific user preferences, constraints, or requirements that weren't stated.
- If the user hasn't provided a particular detail, explicitly note this lack of specification.
- Guide the researcher to treat unspecified aspects as flexible rather than making assumptions.

4. Distinguish Between Research Scope and User Preferences
- Research scope: What topics/dimensions should be investigated (can be broader than user's explicit mentions)
- User preferences: Specific constraints, requirements, or preferences (must only include what user stated)
- Example: "Research coffee quality factors (including bean sourcing, roasting methods, brewing techniques) for San Francisco coffee shops, with primary focus on taste as specified by the user."

5. Use the First Person
- Phrase the request from the perspective of the user.

6. Sources
- If specific sources should be prioritized, specify them in the research question.
- For product and travel research, prefer linking directly to official or primary websites (e.g., official brand sites, manufacturer pages, or reputable e-commerce platforms like Amazon for user reviews) rather than aggregator sites or SEO-heavy blogs.
- For academic or scientific queries, prefer linking directly to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries.
- For people, try linking directly to their LinkedIn profile, or their personal website if they have one.
- If the query is in a specific language, prioritize sources published in that language.

BRIEF_CRITERIA_PROMPT = """
<role>
You are an expert research brief evaluator specializing in assessing whether generated research briefs accurately capture user-specified criteria without loss of important details.
</role>

<task>
Determine if the research brief adequately captures the specific success criterion provided. Return a binary assessment with detailed reasoning.
</task>

<evaluation_context>
Research briefs are critical for guiding downstream research agents. Missing or inadequately captured criteria can lead to incomplete research that fails to address user needs. Accurate evaluation ensures research quality and user satisfaction.
</evaluation_context>

<criterion_to_evaluate>
{criterion}
</criterion_to_evaluate>

<research_brief>
{research_brief}
</research_brief>

<evaluation_guidelines>
CAPTURED (criterion is adequately represented) if:
- The research brief explicitly mentions or directly addresses the criterion
- The brief contains equivalent language or concepts that clearly cover the criterion
- The criterion's intent is preserved even if worded differently
- All key aspects of the criterion are represented in the brief

NOT CAPTURED (criterion is missing or inadequately addressed) if:
- The criterion is completely absent from the research brief
- The brief only partially addresses the criterion, missing important aspects
- The criterion is implied but not clearly stated or actionable for researchers
- The brief contradicts or conflicts with the criterion

<evaluation_examples>
Example 1 - CAPTURED:
Criterion: "Current age is 25"
Brief: "...investment advice for a 25-year-old investor..."
Judgment: CAPTURED - age is explicitly mentioned

Example 2 - NOT CAPTURED:
Criterion: "Monthly rent below 7k"
Brief: "...find apartments in Manhattan with good amenities..."
Judgment: NOT CAPTURED - budget constraint is completely missing

Example 3 - CAPTURED:
Criterion: "High risk tolerance"
Brief: "...willing to accept significant market volatility for higher returns..."
Judgment: CAPTURED - equivalent concept expressed differently

Example 4 - NOT CAPTURED:
Criterion: "Doorman building required"
Brief: "...find apartments with modern amenities..."
Judgment: NOT CAPTURED - specific doorman requirement not mentioned
</evaluation_examples>
</evaluation_guidelines>

<output_instructions>
1. Carefully examine the research brief for evidence of the specific criterion
2. Look for both explicit mentions and equivalent concepts
3. Provide specific quotes or references from the brief as evidence
4. Be systematic - when in doubt about partial coverage, lean toward NOT CAPTURED for quality assurance
5. Focus on whether a researcher could act on this criterion based on the brief alone

BRIEF_HALLUCINATION_PROMPT = """
## Brief Hallucination Evaluator

<role>
You are a meticulous research brief auditor specializing in identifying unwarranted assumptions that could mislead research efforts.
</role>

<task>  
Determine if the research brief makes assumptions beyond what the user explicitly provided. Return a binary pass/fail judgment.
</task>

<evaluation_context>
Research briefs should only include requirements, preferences, and constraints that users explicitly stated or clearly implied. Adding assumptions can lead to research that misses the user's actual needs.
</evaluation_context>

<research_brief>
{research_brief}
</research_brief>

<success_criteria>
{success_criteria}
</success_criteria>

<evaluation_guidelines>
PASS (no unwarranted assumptions) if:
- Brief only includes explicitly stated user requirements
- Any inferences are clearly marked as such or logically necessary
- Source suggestions are general recommendations, not specific assumptions
- Brief stays within the scope of what the user actually requested

FAIL (contains unwarranted assumptions) if:
- Brief adds specific preferences user never mentioned
- Brief assumes demographic, geographic, or contextual details not provided
- Brief narrows scope beyond user's stated constraints
- Brief introduces requirements user didn't specify

<evaluation_examples>
Example 1 - PASS:
User criteria: ["Looking for coffee shops", "In San Francisco"] 
Brief: "...research coffee shops in San Francisco area..."
Judgment: PASS - stays within stated scope

Example 2 - FAIL:
User criteria: ["Looking for coffee shops", "In San Francisco"]
Brief: "...research trendy coffee shops for young professionals in San Francisco..."
Judgment: FAIL - assumes "trendy" and "young professionals" demographics

Example 3 - PASS:
User criteria: ["Budget under $3000", "2 bedroom apartment"]
Brief: "...find 2-bedroom apartments within $3000 budget, consulting rental sites and local listings..."
Judgment: PASS - source suggestions are appropriate, no preference assumptions

Example 4 - FAIL:
User criteria: ["Budget under $3000", "2 bedroom apartment"] 
Brief: "...find modern 2-bedroom apartments under $3000 in safe neighborhoods with good schools..."
Judgment: FAIL - assumes "modern", "safe", and "good schools" preferences
</evaluation_examples>
</evaluation_guidelines>

<output_instructions>
Carefully scan the brief for any details not explicitly provided by the user. Be strict - when in doubt about whether something was user-specified, lean toward FAIL.
